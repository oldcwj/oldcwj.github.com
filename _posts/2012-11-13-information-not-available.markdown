title: Information not available
---
Upgrading to [Arq 3.0](http://www.haystacksoftware.com/arq/) prompted me to try to find out how much data I was storing on Amazon [S3](http://aws.amazon.com/s3/) and [Glacier](http://aws.amazon.com/glacier/). I tried going to the [AWS Management Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/console/home) to find the numbers. Nothing. Logged into my account, and tried “*Account Activity*” and “*Usage Reports*”. Good luck with that!

Puzzled, I called Amazon. The person who took my call was very polite. He even followed through via an email, in which he wrote “*I apologize that the answers I provided over the phone were not the best possible answers for your needs.*” The puzzling thing is, Amazon was not able to give me the information I was looking for: how much data sits on my S3 buckets and on Glacier? I get charged for it, to the cent, yet that information is not readily available?

Having that data readily available to customers, in easy human readable format, Amazon, is that too much to ask? After all, [others](http://s3tools.org/s3cmd) [can](http://www.cloudberrylab.com/free-amazon-s3-explorer-cloudfront-IAM.aspx) [do it](http://www.bucketexplorer.com/), why not you?
