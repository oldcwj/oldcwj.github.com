I am not happy with Sprint, I think it is a bad company. That, of course, is my opinion.

I left them and took the hit of the early termination fee (ETF) because their service in my area was, and is, not usable. Even though I had documented the many times I called for not having reception, not able to make calls, and their “unlimited” data plan been unusable, I paid the ETF and decided to move on.

What I wasn’t counting on was the taxes they, or my local government, charged me. They charged me taxes on an early termination fee! What a bunch of thieves! I think it is crooked, shady, and dishonest, whether it is Sprint [pocketing the money], or the local government.

I am never going back to them. I would rather not use a telephone, if it comes to it, than using Sprint.
