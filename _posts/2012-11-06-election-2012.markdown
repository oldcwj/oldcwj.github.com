title: Election 2012
---
This year I voted via an absentee ballot. Painless and easy, no lines, no rush, with plenty of time to do my research. Perfect. My choice below. The [hedcut](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hedcut) image is from [Noli Novak](http://hedcuts.blogspot.com/2008/12/color.html).

But standing in line is not that bad, really. You can make new friends, hear some jokes, and have an overall good time. But even if you hate standing in line, please vote. Exert your right, and count your choice in.
