My name is David Collantes, and this is what is on my mind, in the form of a personal weblog. In here I write about whatever happens to interest me or, simply, whatever comes to mind and I feel like writing down.

I have worked for the Florida educational system since June of 1996 or whereabouts, but nothing on this site is affiliated with, sponsored, or endorsed by them.

I have a wife, a kid and many family members, from both, my wife's and my own side. We all live in Orlando, "_The City Beautiful_", and Miami, Florida respectively.

If you need anything and need to contact me, I can be easily [reached](mailto:david@collantes.us). For comments or questions on specific entries, please include the [URI](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_Resource_Identifier "URI") of the page you refer to on your email. My reply time is normally fast. I am also often on [Gtalk](http://www.google.com/talk/) under the same contact email address. On social networks, I am mostly on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/davidcollantes) and [Google Plus](https://plus.google.com/u/0/102645326406320209975/).
